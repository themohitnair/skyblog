## Why FastAPI?

1. **Lightning Fast**: Built on Starlette and Pydantic, FastAPI delivers high performance that rivals Go and Node.js.
2. **Easy to Use**: With intuitive design and excellent documentation, FastAPI has a gentle learning curve.
3. **Modern Python**: Leverages Python 3.6+ features like type hints for increased productivity and fewer bugs.
4. **Automatic Docs**: Generates interactive API documentation out of the box.

Here's a glimpse of how simple it is to create an API with FastAPI:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello, FastAPI!"}
```

This small snippet gives you a fully functional API with automatic interactive documentation.
